## Hi there 👋
I’m Sanjay, a Computer Science engineering student from India, focused on building a strong career in Data Science and Machine Learning.

I’m currently working as a Data Science Intern, where I actively work with real-world data, apply machine learning concepts, and strengthen my foundation in statistics and probability. I believe in learning by building and improving through practice.

My core focus is turning data into insights and solutions using Python and ML tools. I’m continuously building projects that reflect practical problem-solving and industry-relevant skills.

I’m preparing for internships and full-time roles where I can contribute, learn fast, and grow as a data professional.
